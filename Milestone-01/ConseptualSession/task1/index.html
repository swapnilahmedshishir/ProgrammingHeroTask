            <h2>This is very beautiful Food</h2>
            <p>When Ferdinand Schaller and Tony Weber opened the doors of their modest butcher shop back in 1937, they were catering to the needs of the German immigrants in their Yorkville neighborhood. Schaller & Weber was the perfect market for patrons to purchase the cured meats and wursts of their distant homeland. Ever since then Schaller & Weber has been crafting New York Cityâ€™s most authentic German style sausage and charcuterie, and now with nearly a century of of experience, Schaller & Weber is known internationally as a symbol of taste and quality.</p>
